    <h1><span class="emoji">üíå</span> A Letter for You</h1>
    <p>Dear Selina,</p>
    <p>
      This letter shall be a unqiue one, not what you expect. Im not here to call you gorgeous, pretty or cute. For you have heard those words all your life, along with the bad.
      I understand why you are self conscios when you care so much for others. Yet you hear them call you all sorts from beautiful to ulgy, loud to silent, fat to skinny. 
      When poeple judge your whole being its hard to know who you are when you been called everything, when you are called unique and special every day but its crazy how each person can see you in a differnet way.
      So ofc you sit there looking at yourself seeing all these opinions unable to describe yourself. I bet you say; Im fat but skinny, ugly yet Beautiful, quiet yet loud. You love being in a crowds yet love being alone.
      Each person sees another in a special way, the person you wish to be is another persons greatest fear to see.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I wish you could see how you look from my eyes, how youre eyes glisten, how goregous you're hair flows, the way your smile brightnes up the darkests of nights for me.
      How passionate you are for your friends, how you care for those you love. I wish you could see what I see and ignore the rest.
      For then you would know how perfect you are. For I fear if you arent good at loving yourself, you will have a difficult time to love anyone else.
      You will build resentment for having so much love for someone else that you dont have for yourself, to give so much time to someone, you arent even giving to ones self.
      No other love or compliments no matter how genuine it is, will ever can fufill your heart better than ones uncoditional self-love.
      So please, love yourself for who you are, for that is the women I feel in love with before I had even seen her.
    </p>
    <p class="sig">Forever yours, <br/>‚Äî Connie</p>
